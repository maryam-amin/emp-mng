This is a simple CRUD based employee management web app, using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB, and tested using Postman.

The emp-mng folder is a React folder that contains the backend folder for this project.

This project contains one entity, which is the employee.
The employee's schema consists of 5 fields, and the id attribute is the automatically generated unique id of MongoDB.

The API endpoints are in the routes/employees.js file with each requirement commented above.

To connect to the MongoDB database, replace the ATLAS_URI string in the dotenv file to your database's connection string and password.
